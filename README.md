# CS-370

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I created a deep q-learning model to solve a maze using reinforcement learning. I was given starter code with a maze and win conditions defined, and I created and trained the model to complete the maze.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science

Computer scientists use computers to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to do. In this example, solving the maze as a human is fairly simple because it is so small. However, given much larger and difficult mazes it would be very difficult and time-consuming to solve it. In this case, a machine learning model like I created can be used to solve a maze and then solve extremely difficult and complex mazes much, much quicker than humanly possible. This ability to harness the power of machines to improve our good is why computer scientists are so important. As a computer scientist, I approach problems using an algorithm, problem solving approach. I break the problem down into small repeatable steps that when put together solve the larger problem. My ethical responsibilities are to protect the privacy and well-being of the users as well as protect the intellectual property of the organization.
